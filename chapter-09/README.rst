# Chapter 9: Files and Exceptions

This chapter covers working with files and exceptions in Python. It covers the following topics:

- Reading and writing files
- Using `try` and `except` statements to handle exceptions
- Raising exceptions
- Using `finally` clause
- The `with` statement
- Storing data using JSON

Examples are provided throughout the chapter to help you understand and apply the concepts covered. By the end of the chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with files and handle exceptions in Python and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.

## Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to write your own classes. You learned how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write meth-ods that give your classes the behavior they need. You learned to write
__init__() methods that create instances from your classes with exactly the attributes you want. You saw how to modify the attributes of an instance directly and through methods. You learned that inheritance can simplify the creation of classes that are related to each other, and you learned to use instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep each class simple.You saw how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need into the files where they’ll be used can keep your projects organized. You started learning about the Python standard library, and you saw an example based on the random module. Finally, you learned to style your classes using Python conventions.In Chapter 10, you’ll learn to work with files so you can save the work you’ve done in a program and the work you’ve allowed users to do. You’ll also learn about exceptions, a special Python class designed to help you respond to errors when they arise.

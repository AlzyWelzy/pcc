# Chapter 4: Lists and Dictionaries

This chapter covers working with lists and dictionaries in Python. It covers the following topics:

- Creating, accessing and modifying lists and dictionaries
- Using list and dictionary methods
- Indexing and slicing lists
- Nesting lists and dictionaries
- Using lists and dictionaries to store data

Examples are provided throughout the chapter to help you understand and apply the concepts covered. By the end of the chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with lists and dictionaries in Python and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.

## Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a list. You learned how to work through a list using a for loop, how Python uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a few operations you can perform on numerical lists. You learned how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a slice. You also learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change, and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read.In Chapter 5, you’ll learn to respond appropriately to different condi-tions by using if statements. You’ll learn to string together relatively complex sets of conditional tests to respond appropriately to exactly the kind of situa-tion or information you’re looking for. You’ll also learn to use if statements while looping through a list to take specific actions with selected elements from a list.

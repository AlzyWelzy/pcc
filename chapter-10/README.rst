# Chapter 10: Testing

This chapter covers the concept of testing in Python. It covers the following topics:

- The importance of testing
- Using the `unittest` module
- Writing test methods
- Using assert methods
- Testing a class
- Using fixtures
- Creating test suites

Examples are provided throughout the chapter to help you understand and apply the concepts covered. By the end of the chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to write and run tests in Python and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.

## Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to work with files. You learned to read the entire contents of a file, and then work through the contents one line at a time if you need to. You learned to write as much text as you want to a file. You also read about exceptions and how to handle the exceptions you’re likely to see in your programs. Finally, you learned how to store Python data structures so you can save information your users provide, preventing them from having to start over each time they run a program.In Chapter 11, you’ll learn efficient ways to test your code. This will help you trust that the code you develop is correct, and it will help you identify bugs that are introduced as you continue to build on the programs you’ve written.

of the information in a dictionary. You learned to loop through a diction-ary’s key-value pairs, its keys, and its values. You also learned how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.In the next chapter you’ll learn about while loops and how to accept input from people who are using your programs. This will be an exciting chapter, because you’ll learn to make all of your programs interactive: they’ll be able to respond to user input.

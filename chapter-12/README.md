# Chapter 12

## Summary
In this chapter, you learned to make a plan for a game and learned the basic structure of a game written in Pygame. You learned to set a back-ground color and store settings in a separate class where you can adjust them more easily. You saw how to draw an image to the screen and give the player control over the movement of game elements. You created elements that move on their own, like bullets flying up a screen, and you deleted objects that are no longer needed. You also learned to refactor code in a project on a regular basis to facilitate ongoing development.In Chapter 13, we’ll add aliens to Alien Invasion. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to shoot down aliens, hopefully before they reach your ship!

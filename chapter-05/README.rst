# Chapter 5: Conditional Statements

This chapter covers working with conditional statements in Python. It covers the following topics:

- Using if, elif, and else statements
- Comparing values
- Boolean expressions and operators
- Using the `not` and `and` keywords
- Using `in` and `not in` operators

Examples are provided throughout the chapter to help you understand and apply the concepts covered. By the end of the chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to use conditional statements in Python and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.

## Summary
In this chapter you learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False. You learned to write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-elif-else chains. You began using these structures to identify particular conditions you need to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop. You also revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand.In Chapter 6 you’ll learn about Python’s dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but it allows you to connect pieces of information. You’ll learn how to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combi-nation with lists and if statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations.

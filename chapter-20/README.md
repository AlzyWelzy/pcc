# Chapter 20
## Summary
In this chapter, you learned to give your projects a simple but professional appearance using the Bootstrap library and the django-bootstrap5 app. With Bootstrap, the styles you choose will work consistently on almost any device people use to access your project.You learned about Bootstrap’s templates and used the Navbar static tem-plate to create a simple look and feel for Learning Log. You used a jumbo-tron to make a home page’s message stand out, and learned to style all the pages in a site consistently.In the final part of the project, you learned how to deploy a project to a remote server so anyone can access it. You made a Platform.sh account and installed some tools that help manage the deployment process. You used Git to commit the working project to a repository, and then pushed the repository to a remote server on Platform.sh. Finally, you learned to begin securing your app by setting DEBUG = False on the live server. You also made custom error pages, so the inevitable errors that come up will look well-handled.Now that you’ve finished Learning Log, you can start building your own projects. Start simple, and make sure the project works before adding com-plexity. Enjoy your continued learning, and good luck with your projects!

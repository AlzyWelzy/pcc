You detected and responded to colli-sions when bullets hit aliens and aliens hit the ship. You also learned how to track statistics in a game and use a game_active flag to determine when the game is over.In the next and final chapter of this project, we’ll add a Play button so the player can choose when to start their first game and whether to play again when the game ends. We’ll speed up the game each time the player shoots down the entire fleet, and we’ll add a scoring system. The final result will be a fully playable game!
